# Project1 | Part 1 -> "Accio" File using TCP (Client)

# What does this Program do?
- This is the client that connects to a "Broken" Server provided by the professor (See Below) that will ask for 
two of the same "accio/r/n" commands and once receieved will begin to start sending over to the server a file of 
the user's choice. 

# Broken Server Information
- IP: 131.94.128.43 Port: 54634
- Server Link: http://morty.cs.fiu.edu:18080/

# Project1 | Part 2 -> "Accio" File using TCP (Server Simplified)

   # What does this Program do?
   - This is a simple server that allows up to 10 client servers on either a localhost or a designated host to connect and send over a 
     file of sizes 500 bytes to  100 MiBytes
